## Networking

### OSI Model
- The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a communication system into distinct layers
-  The model defines how communication between two endpoints in a network occurs and provides a reference for understanding network protocols and their interactions.


- The OSI model consists of seven layers, each representing a specific function or set of functions in the communication process. These layers are:
* Physical layer
* Datalink layer
* Network layer
* Transport layer
* Session Layer
* Presentation layer
* Application layer
