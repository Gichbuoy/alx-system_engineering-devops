## API
- API stands for **Application Programming Interface.** 
- It is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.
- APIs are used to enable the integration of different software systems, allowing them to work together and share data or functionality.

## What is a REST API:

REST stands for **Representational State Transfer.** 
- A RESTful API is an architectural style for designing networked applications. 
- It uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to perform operations on resources, which can be represented in different formats such as JSON or XML.
- REST APIs are designed to be stateless, meaning each request from a client contains all the information needed to process the request.
